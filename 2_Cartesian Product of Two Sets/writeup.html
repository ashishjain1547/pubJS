<h2>Cartesian Products of Sets</h2>

Suppose A is a set of 2 colours and B is a set of 3 objects, i.e.,

A = {red, blue} and 
B = {b, c, s}

where b, c and s represent a particular bag, coat and shirt, respectively.

How many pairs of coloured objects can be made from these two sets?

Proceeding in a very orderly manner, we can see that there will be 6
distinct pairs as given below:
(red, b), (red, c), (red, s), (blue, b), (blue, c), (blue, s).

Thus, we get 6 distinct objects (Fig 2.1).

Let us recall from our earlier classes that an ordered pair of elements taken from any two sets P and Q is a pair of elements written in small 
brackets and grouped together in a particular order, i.e., (p,q), p ∈ P and q ∈ Q . This
leads to the following definition:
Definition 1 Given two non-empty sets P and Q. The cartesian product P × Q is the
set of all ordered pairs of elements from P and Q, i.e.,
P × Q = { (p,q) : p ∈ P, q ∈ Q }
If either P or Q is the null set, then P × Q will also be empty set, i.e., P × Q = φ

From the illustration given above we note that

A × B = {(red,b), (red,c), (red,s), (blue,b), (blue,c), (blue,s)}







Example 2 If P = {a, b, c} and Q = {r}, form the sets P × Q and Q × P.
Are these two products equal?
Solution By the definition of the cartesian product,
P × Q = {(a, r), (b, r), (c, r)} and Q × P = {(r, a), (r, b), (r, c)}
Since, by the definition of equality of ordered pairs, the pair (a, r) is not equal to the pair (r, a), we conclude that P × Q ≠ Q × P.
However, the number of elements in each set will be the same.




There is a Tuple & Record proposal for JavaScript but it is only in Stage 2 now so its API is not finalized and it is not implemented in any browser yet.
